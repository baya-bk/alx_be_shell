Brief explanation of each command in your script:

1. **`#!/bin/bash`**: Specifies the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

2. **`su betty`**: Switches the user to the user named "betty"

3. **`id -un`**: Prints the **username** of the current user.

4. **`touch hello`**: Creates an empty file named `hello` if it doesn't exist, or updates the file's last modified time if it already exists.

5. **`chmod 775 hello`**: Changes the permissions of the file `hello` to **rwxrwxr-x** (owner and group have read, write, and execute permissions; others have read and execute permissions).

6. **`-rwxr-x-wx 1 julien julien 23 Sep 20 14:25 hello`**: This is not a command; it appears to be the **output of `ls -l`**, displaying file permissions, owner, group, size, modification time, and name.
